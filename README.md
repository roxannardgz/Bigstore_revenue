**Sprint 10: A/B Testing - Tripleten**


In collaboration with the Marketing Department, the Analytics Department has compiled a list of hypotheses aimed at boosting revenue. The objective is to prioritize these hypotheses, conduct an A/B test, and analyze the outcomes to determine the optimal strategy.

## Overview

Big Store is a leading online retail platform, constantly exploring strategies to increase revenue. After data preprocessing and preparation, the project is divided into two main parts:

* **Part 1:** Prioritization of nine hypotheses using the ICE and RICE methods to assess their potential impact on revenue.
* **Part 2:** Calculation and visualization of key metrics, followed by A/B testing to draw conclusions on the best course of action. This analysis includes data on transactions and visits during the test period.

The second part also involves a statistical analysis to determine the significance of differences in conversion rates and average order size, helping to establish whether the observed differences are statistically significant or due to random variation. The hypotheses tested are as follows:

### Hypothesis 1
The conversion rates for both groups are equal, implying that any observed differences occur due to chance.

`H₀: P₁ = P₂ - there is no difference in conversion rates between the two groups`

`H₁: P₁ ≠ P₂ - there is a difference in conversion rates between the two groups`

### Hypothesis 2
The difference in average order size between the test groups is equal.

`H₀: µ₁ = µ₂ - there is no difference in the average order size between the two groups`

`H₁: µ₁ ≠ µ₂ - there is a difference in the average order size between the two groups`
